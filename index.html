 <h2>About Me</h2>
 
 <p>
 	Although I go by Shane my first name is actual Joseph my father and I both share the same first name and go by our middle names. I was born in Hawaii in September of 1995. Three years later my family along with my recently born sister moved to Delaware then a few years later Central Florida, which is where I consider Home. I currently work at the Cocoa Beach Pier. I've work there for 3 years (or what I consider to be my entire adult life) I am an avid photographer, I've taken pictures in many cities through out the world such as Tokyo Japan and New York, New York, as well as many small towns in Georgia and Kentucky. In what little free time I have I work on restoring my 1981 Vw Scirocco, did I mention I like cars? I really like cars, Like A Lot! I am a regular at Orlando Speed World. I am very much looking forward to my future career in the Web Development field or whatever happens to catch my interest along the journey through this boot camp. Feel free to contact me though the contact tab on right with any questions, Cheers!
